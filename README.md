# Description
It consists of  two programs inside this repository :
1. index.js : this program is responsible for finding the even and odd numbers from the random array .
2. app.js : this program is responsible for printing the prime numbers and then stored all the prime numbers inside one another array (primeArray) , and out of this array we have found one maximum element and one minimum element.
Also printed the sum of all the array elements present inside the new array (primeArray).

# Answers to the codes :
1. index.js:  the answer of this code came out to be :
3 odd numbers
7 odd numbers  
2 even numbers 
15 odd numbers 
9 odd numbers  
20 even numbers
5 odd numbers  
14 even numbers
12 even numbers
1 odd numbers  
8 even numbers 
11 odd numbers
6 even numbers
19 odd numbers
4 even numbers
10 even numbers
17 odd numbers
13 odd numbers
16 even numbers
18 even numbers

2. app.js : the answer to this code came out to be :
19 is a prime number 
23 is a prime number 
4 its not a prime number
16 its not a prime number
28 its not a prime number
13 is a prime number
31 is a prime number
8 its not a prime number
29 is a prime number
14 its not a prime number
6 its not a prime number
35 its not a prime number
2 is a prime number
11 is a prime number
17 is a prime number
5 is a prime number
9 its not a prime number
27 its not a prime number
12 its not a prime number
30 its not a prime number
this the new array containing all the prime numbers inside it :  [
  19, 23, 13, 31, 29,
   2, 11, 17,  5
]
[ 2 ] is the minimum number 
[ 31 ] is the maximum number
150 it is the sum of all the array elements present inside the array.

# Expected output 
1. index.js : 
2 is even number 
13 is odd number...............

2. app.js :
2 is prime number .
12 is not a prime number .
maximum element is : 
minimum element is :
sum of all the array elements is :
